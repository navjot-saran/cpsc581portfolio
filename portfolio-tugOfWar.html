          <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" class="mb-4">Project Details</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >The project we chose to take on is a Tug of War app. In this app two users will compete head on to try and pull the rope towards themselves. In order to do this they will click the hands(button) which will then pull the rope towards them while also making the background gradient become the winner’s team color (red or blue). While doing this there will be a bar on the side of the screen which will go up and down and will determine how strong of a pull the user will have on the rope. If the user clicks the button and the slider is on the white section, then the rope will move towards the user by a large margin, however if the slider is on the black section, then the rope will move towards the other user by a large margin. When the slider isn't on the black or white section then the rope will move towards the user slightly which is also the most likely to occur.</p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" class="mb-4">How and why we came up with it</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >We initially started by coming up with 10 ideas among ourselves and drawing our own implementations of it. Then we discussed amongst ourselves and got feedback on our ideas from the TA as well. The TA liked our tug of war idea the most. We came up with this idea while talking about activities you might do while at the park. With Tug of War being an interaction between 2 people, we decided to go with it. While that is how we came up with the main idea for the game the background gradient is something we took from another game we were planning to create. Finally the bar is something we came up with while talking to our TA as we decided to add more layers to the way users interact with the buttons.</p>

          <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >Detailed Sketches</h2>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_buttons.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_buttons.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >Our initial design was very simple just as a proof of concept, but it did not have the feel or the look of a tug of war game. We started by changing it to a hand emoji but it once again did not deliver the look of a tug of war game. We experimented with animating the hands to demonstrate pulling, as well as a button that moves. We had to scrap the animation due to technical challenges. We also scrapped the moving button idea since it felt gimmicky.</p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_pulse.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_pulse.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >We thought the game needed to have more depth than just spamming the button. This is why he thought of the idea to make the button become darker at times so the user has to time it in order to have a stronger pull.</p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_mv_button.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_mv_button.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >The moving button idea was suggested by Fysal after discussing how to make the interaction with the button more dynamic. Instead of the player interacting with a static fixed button the button would move around within a bounded space. The benefits of this implementation would be that players would be penalized for trying to mash the button without having to think. Alternatively, players would have to be paying attention to the button shifting position if they wanted to keep the lead. Failure to do so would result in wasted time clicking the previous button location. This system would reward attentive players who are both visually “connecting the dots” between their physical senses (touch) and visual senses (sight). Although this would add a layer of depth to the game space the issue is that since we transitioned from a button to a physical rope spread across the screen with two hand-shaped buttons constituting players holding a rope (hence the theme of tug-of-war). Therefore, having the button move and thus detach from the rope itself is jarring and breaks the logical take away of two players tugging on a rope. We ultimately decided to not incorporate this feature in our final design, even so, it gives a different perspective to the game that could be a feature in a variation of the tug of war concept. </p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_score.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_score.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >The idea for a scoreboard was a collective idea we had early in the design process. We knew that any two player game should accommodate a competitive player base who are focused on the winning/losing aspect to the game. To deal with this we knew we had to have some way of keeping track of player score. This early concept sketch shows a corner scoreboard showing player 1 and 2 scores displayed in the user interface. As our game is intended to be played on a mobile device, we did not want to clutter the UI with a scoreboard. Instead, we ended up opting for a win screen that would be displayed after a round is complete.</p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_knot.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_knot.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >Our first iterations used a knot in the middle that would move towards the winning player. Later we learned that real tug of war actually uses a flag instead of a knot, so we decided to replace it with a flag for our final version.</p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_multitouch.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_multitouch.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >This was one of the most important functions that we had to implement. We needed our game to be multi-touch capable so the gameplay feels smooth. Before implementing this feature, we were discussing other ideas such as the pulsing button to make the game more turn based. </p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_fullscreen.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_fullscreen.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >The game did not feel as immersive as a “game” like with a visible browser nav bar. So we collectively decided we would need to make our game fullscreen. We initially had a button to make the window fullscreen. But we felt that it looked terrible and cluttered the screen, so instead we implemented a feature where if you tap anywhere on the screen except the hands, it will make the window fullscreen. If it is already in fullscreen, then it will go back to windowed mode. </p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_win.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_win.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >This is the game win screen, when a player wins they see this screen. We decided on this instead of a scorecard on the main game screen because the scorecard would clutter up the main game window. The rematch button allows the players to keep playing without resetting the score. The reset game button resets the scores and the game. </p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_gradient.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_gradient.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >The gradient idea was suggested by Andy because we thought the game felt very boring with a static grass background and a small moving knot. It is a red and blue gradient, the color of the winning player slowly starts taking over the screen. The closer a player is to winning, the more of the screen is taken up by their color. This served as a secondary feedback to the user and observers. It makes it very clear who is winning even to somewhat distant observers that cannot see the flag. We decided to get rid of the screen counter because the flag and gradient background felt it was enough to convey game state to players, and the score box would clutter the game screen. </p>
          <a data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" href="images/detailed_bar.png" class="mb-3 d-block" data-fancybox="gal"><img src="images/detailed_bar.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid"></a>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">The power bar idea was suggested by Harprabh after discussion with the TA and the prof about the feel and interaction of the game. We wanted to move away from two users just mashing the button as fast as possible and add more depth to the interaction while keeping the overall feel of the game the same. Our initial iteration had a bar with a small white section in the middle with a “slider” bar constantly moving up and down. If the user taps the button when the slider is on the white section, then that user gets a larger pull distance compared to tapping while the slider is in any other part of the bar. But this version did not change the interaction from two people mashing the keys since it was still the optimal strategy to win. Then we decided to add a black zone on either side of the white zone. This zone was created to “punish” the user for tapping the button if the slider was in the black area, instead giving the opponent a large pull distance toward their side. Tug of War is a little more complex than simply pulling as hard as possible. So game mechanics based on some rhythm and timing made sense. The black bar incentivises users to time their hits rather than button mash alone. Tug of War is still a game of strength so button mashing wasn’t eliminated entirely. The button mashing in the clear ends of the power bar simulates strenuous pulling during a real match, while the timing around the black/white bars simulates the timing and rhythm components of the game. We also decided to make the bonus points of landing in the white zone to be five times the normal points. This incentivizes players to take risks by focusing on the timing/rhythm aspect. They must now decide if they wish to play it safe by momentarily pausing as the small bar enters the punishment area or they can gamble and try to win very quickly by hitting the sweet spot in the white zone. </p>

          <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >Concept Sketches</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >While deciding on which app to make we each had initially come up with 10 designs, those being a memory game, tug of war game, coloring game, plant simulator, campfire simulator, gradient game, darts game, where's Waldo game, 5 seconds game, fishing game, brick breaker, carnival strength game, baseball game and a pet simulator. Out of all these ideas we eventually picked the tug of war game as it supports multiplayer (not online) and creates a competitive environment for the players. We also implemented the gradient game idea into the tug of war game as we made the background a gradient that changes depending on who is winning.</p>

          <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >My Contribution</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >After the games setup by Fysal, my initial goal was to make the button animations of an opening and closing fist. I tried to implement sprite animation but it didn’t work with the CSS setup without breaking the whole thing. Then I found images online and edited them to make them unique. I designed the buttons, flag and rope. I focused on making the buttons pop out from the background to attract user attention. Adding these changes to the game was difficult at first but I ended up getting more familiar with CSS. This made it possible for me to help Harprabh add the power bar. I also contributed to the project documentation.</p>

          <h2 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >Limitations and Issues</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100" >One of the most glaring issues in our system is how the gradient and flag moves. The flag moves towards the winning player, but the winning player’s color moves toward the loser’s side from the winner’s side. This can be jarring for some users because the only 2 moving parts in our app move in 2 different directions. After discussing with the TA, we came up with two possible solutions, one being the whole screen slowly becomes the winner’s color and the other being able to expand the color gradients from the center to the player. Since we had this discussion the day before the due date, we could not implement both features and decided to keep our original implementation.

            The second issue being lack of instructions provided to the user about the power bar. It might not be intuitive from the start that the black zone is a punishment zone and the white zone is a “sweet spot”.
